On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ until 02.05.2020 ~

This week I learned sending variables from activity to activity in Android Studio. Also I learden to open new activity when I click a button. This week me and Faruk made a brainstorm about Settings page. We helped each other because his page and my page have connection. We made profile page.

### ~ 02.05.2020 - 11.05.2020 ~

We combined our parts with Faruk. Thus, interface of the profile page has been completed. We will try to find out how to include Firebase in the project. Also ,as a group, we tried to combine all parts. However we encountered with some errors. We are still working to combine all parts. 

### ~  11.05.2020 - 18.05.2020 ~

This week, firstly we encountered with a problem that stops working the application. We couldn't open the MainActivity from LoginFragment. After clicking login button we couldn't open MainActivity and the application stopped itself. However, I was using the codes in Profile that moves us from ProfileFragment to Settings. Then I used same codes to LoginFragment and then the problem is solved. After this we started to work on pins. We tried to connect pins with "Create an Event".

### ~  18.05.2020 - 25.05.2020 ~

This week, we usually worked as a group. We tried to solve some problems before video recording for demo. As a group, we met every day and tried to solve most of the main problems. We mostly finished the UI section. There are only a few things left, such as adjusting color integrity and fonts. We also started working on Firebase. We installed Firebase.
