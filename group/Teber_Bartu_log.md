On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### Until 02.05.2020
I learn basic tools and use of Android Studio by reading and watching tutorials. After determining the project details by discussing them together, I started working on my own part, the design of login and register page.  After determining the design of the login and register page, I started working on the code. I brainstormed with the group members on the errors I encountered. After consulting the TA on the last remaining error, I completed the login and register page design.

### 02.05.2020 - 10.05.2020
We made a research about firebase and how to store the usernames and passwords of users to let them log in we are still working on it. Also as a group we try to combine all of our parts. We encountered with some errors, we solved most and still trying to solve the rest. 

### 10.05.2020 - 18.05.2020
In this week we have worked on the pins on the map and how to connect them with creating event activities. Also we use onTouchEvent() to make the pins clickable so that the event list in that area can be shown. 

### 18.05.2020 - 25.05.2020
In this week I had a research about firebase and we set up the firebase into our project. We also fixed some of the errors.
