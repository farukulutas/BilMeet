On This page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ until 02.05.2020 ~
So far, I have made the event list page of our application.I learned how android studio works. While doing this page, I learned to make the components visible and invisible and to adjust the position of the panels aesthetically.
I had some difficulties in coding the actions that should be done when we click on the buttons, but I got over it.Apart from these, I tried to help my group friends as much as I could.

### ~ from 02.05.2020 until 11.05.2020 ~
We tried to combine the parts we made under one project. We got various errors (null reference, null pointers, package errors ...). We corrected most of the errors and combined some parts. I also create the 'Create an Event' page that allows user to create an even with specific name and type.

### ~ from 11.05.2020 until 18.05.2020 ~
This week we first worked on adding a location cursor on the map. Tuğberk and i figured out how to integrate library that Tuğberk found about this situation into our own code and add it to our code. We fixed some errors in the code. Then, when I clicked the cursors on the map, I tried to get the activities of that region to come.

### ~ from 18.05.2020 until 25.05.2020 ~
This week we started the firebase installation and took the promotional video of our application. I installed firebase with my google account and added our own project to it. I tried to save the bilkent mail and password on the registration screen of our application and I succeeded.
### ~ from 25.05.2020 until 28.05.2020 ~
In these 3 days, I set up the register page to accept bilkent mail only. I checked if the entered passwords match each other. I changed the student number to only accept 8 digits and added error text. In order to find out whether each mail really belongs to the person, I ensured that the verification mail was sent and I directed it to a page where the user could ask for a code again so that the user would not be in a difficult situation if it could not be sent.
