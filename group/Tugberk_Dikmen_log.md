On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. 
This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ until 02.05.2020 ~
Until this week I work on main screen and menu driver object. While doing those I learned how to 
design user interface, how android studio works and adding zoom properties to image on android studio. 
While compleating those steps we brainstormed about the erros that we had. When this week is over we had fully working menu and main screen. 
### ~ 02.05.2020 - 10.05.2020 ~
In this week I worked on how to add and implement markers and buttons to the zoomable image view on android studio.
In addition, I sperated the map view into three part in order to make it more easy for users. Last, we worked on combining all the the part of the project ass a group.
### ~ 10.05.2020 - 18.05.2020 ~
In this week I worked on adding adjustable pin activity to our image map and also linking it to events part and creating event part.
We also encountered with the problems and errors that occured while linking activities to eachother and solved those problems.
### ~ 18.05.2020 - 25.05.2020 ~
In this week we worked on solving some remaining errors. Furthermore I made a research about how to add FireBase to our project. 
We set up the FireBase into our project.
